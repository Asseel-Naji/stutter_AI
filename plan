Okay, let's get serious now.

Here are my options, I have exactly 2 and a half days for this. So here are my options.

A:
    Help the stutterer complete his sentence by replacing hard to pronounce words with a list of alternatives on the fly.
    This can be achieved using GPT2, I'm not quite sure few pages of Jordanian dialect is enough for a proof of concept.

    This will require the following part
        1- lightsail instance for the webpage
                this webpage will just open an audio stream to the transcriber which is gonna be google api since amazon transcribe doesn't support arabic let alone the jordanian accent.
                    this part is easier said than done. It might be actually harder than the GPT2
        2- figure enough of AWS archeticture to manage to deploy a GPT on it, damn that 7:30AM lecture would've been useful lol.
        3- finally, send the sentence to GPT and predict possible completions.
        4- send this list back to the webpage and display them for the stutterer.
    And I just slowly realized I'm building a fancy autocomplete engine.. FML.

B:
    Actually remove the stutter from the voice. Can be a .wav file. This way at least I won't have to deal with streams.
    There is however one downside for this solution. I have no idea where to begin other than it would be MFCC and require a massive dataset
    The chances of me pulling this off in 2 days are practically zero.


wait wait wait. Actually there might be a way out of this mess that would actually solve the problem

C: Do the auditary delayed thingy, It's scientifically proven to help. But augment it with a speech to text solution.
    I'm not sure if this exactly qualifies as A.I, but both reading your words AND hearing delayed voice are proven to help stutterers.
    It's still a fancy voice recorder augmented with a transcriber, but I hope that the other teams aren't doing much better.


COME ON. THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR BRAIN BLOCKS. HOW CAN I USE AI TO SOLVE STUTTERING IN 48 FREAKING HOURS.

So much for a serious document.

Wait, could i use facial ques to detect stuttering?
yes, yes I could. And I can do it in 2 days, however it won't solve stuttering.
mhmm.. how about activating the delayed auditary thingy whenever the AI detects a stutter?

BTW, If you work in amazon and is reading this, I'm typing it because I remember something about having to commit often, I didn't attend the rules lecture so I might be mistaken. Sorry, but this helps me think and you have to endure it.

Hahaha I have a feeling in the end I'll have to just make the fancy voice recorder and commit it in the last 2 hours.

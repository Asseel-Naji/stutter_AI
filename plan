So, missed the meeting today because of my sleep schedule.

It's okay, a bit late, all I have to do in 48 hours is :

plan A :
1- Deploy a GPT.
2- Handwrite enough data in Jordanian dialect so it can predict the upcoming words.
3- Deploy a website that can take speech in Arabic, transcribe it using Google API (Not my fault Amazon doesn't have arabic yet)
   and finally take that speech and pass it to GPT to predict the upcoming possible words and list them to the stutterer to help them out.

Plan B :
Find a way to actually remove the stutter and return a clean voice. It should be easy, all I have to do is get an MFCC based neural network with enough data to remove stutter,
oh it's very simple, all I have to do other than that is analyze the voice samples.

FFS training either approach alone will take more than 48 hours.


Plan C :
Go to sleep while mad at my professor for choosing this subject expecting that a delayed auditary solution has any chance of winning this thing.
"Hey amazon, look, look, I made you a fancy voice recorder, can I have my 10k now?"
Jk jk I love you Dr. Banna.

Ugh, I probably should be more professional given that this is being judged and all, but I doubt anyone will go to this first commit anyway.
if you're reading this, Hi, sorry for wasting your time so far, I hope you have a sense of humor or I'm doomed, hopefully there will be other more impressive commits after and I won't look like a complete hopeless case.
There is still hope, this thing can literally pay for my university.
All I have to do is find a way to solve stuttering. LMFAO and FML. Eh, programming is problem solving after all. let's see.
